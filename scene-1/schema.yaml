# SCENARIO: Multiple Connectors with Different Success Rates
# CASE:     No connector supports debit routing.
#
# This file defines an initial state where multiple processors are active
# with varying success rates, but none have the debit routing capability enabled.

# Global settings for this simulation run.
simulation:
  # The total number of transaction entries to generate.
