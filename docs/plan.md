# Project Plan: Decision Engine Testing Framework

## 1. Objective

The goal of this project is to create a robust testing framework to evaluate the performance of a payment routing Decision Engine.

The framework will be designed to test adaptive, stateful algorithms by simulating a dynamic transaction environment with real-world events like processor outages. It will provide clear, deterministic metrics on an algorithm's efficiency by comparing its choices against a theoretically optimal outcome.

## 2. Core Components

The framework will consist of three main components:

### a. Test Data Generator

This component will generate a file of simulated transactions (e.g., a CSV). Based on a user-defined configuration, it will pre-calculate the outcome (success or failure) for each payment processor on every transaction. This ensures that tests are repeatable and directly comparable, as the element of random luck is removed from the simulation itself.

The generator will be capable of modeling time-based events, such as scheduled processor downtimes, to create a realistic test environment.

### b. Simulation Engine

This is the core of the framework. It reads the generated test data and orchestrates the test execution. For each transaction, it will:
1.  Call the Decision Engine's API to get a routing decision.
2.  Look up the pre-determined outcomes in the test data to simulate whether the transaction would succeed or fail with the suggested processors.
3.  Provide feedback to the Decision Engine via a separate API call after each simulated attempt, allowing the engine to adapt its strategy.
4.  Record the results of the simulation.

### c. Analysis and Reporting

After running the simulation, this component will analyze the results. It will compare the algorithm's actual performance (e.g., total costs incurred) against the theoretical "best possible" performance for the given set of transactions. A summary report will be generated to quantify the algorithm's effectiveness.

## 3. High-Level Workflow

1.  **Configure:** The user defines the simulation parameters, including processor costs and a schedule of time-based events (like success rates changing over time).
2.  **Generate:** The user runs the data generator to create the deterministic test data file.
3.  **Execute:** The user starts the simulation engine, which connects to the running Decision Engine service and begins the test.
4.  **Analyze:** The user reviews the final report to assess the performance of the routing algorithm.
